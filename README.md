# pokedex-js

**Description**: This is a simple project that shows the power of JS in consuming APIs. Here I used Poke-api (https://pokeapi.co/) to build the project, it's super simple, despite the JS source code being a bit advanced, but it's highly readable. The idea is to show the pokemons, and if the end user wants to, he can use the button ("load more") that will return more pokemons from the API until it reaches a limit established in a line of code (151, which represents the first generation of pokemons).
